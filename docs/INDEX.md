## Content model & sources

| Document | What's in it | When you'd read it |
|---|---|---|
| [`aha-and-network.md`](./aha-and-network.md) | **The active priority bet.** 90/10 framing (individual aha vs network); 10 items prioritized; content-quality review; FTUE critical re-review with a button-bloat audit; 4-week ship plan. Living doc — the next four weeks of work ladder here. | Anyone scoping or reviewing growth / aha / FTUE / content work in the next four weeks. **Read first** before opening a feature PR. |
| [`growth-plan-cpo-q1.md`](./growth-plan-cpo-q1.md) | The 5-idea CPO memo — Cold-Start Aha · Spark Cards · Daily Pulse · Build-and-Ship Loop · Cohort Quests. Two items carried into the active queue in [`aha-and-network.md`](./aha-and-network.md); three deferred until that queue lands. | Reviewing the 5-idea horizon. The "where we're going *after* the active 4 weeks" doc. |
| [`content-model.md`](./content-model.md) | **The operating manual for what content *means* at LearnAI.** Compression-not-curriculum thesis · five principles · the user's three choices on every Spark (✅/🔍/⏭) · the source pipeline · just-in-time vocabulary · cognition's role · what we are NOT · the next-PR queue with KPI mappings | Anyone designing a new Spark format, a new content surface, the recommender, or the cognition layer. Read **first** if you're going to touch any of it. |
| [`first-time-builder-findings.md`](./first-time-builder-findings.md) | A driven-the-live-SPA audit by a fresh builder persona — 33 numbered findings, four near-aha moments, top-10 prioritized changes mapped to `metrics.md` | Before reviewing or scoping the next content-experience PR. The empirical ground truth behind `content-model.md` §8. |
| [`test-personas.md`](./test-personas.md) | Internal QA personas (Maya, Jordan) for repeatable FTUE dogfooding · success/failure tells · operating rules · dated findings log. Personas live on `app/src/lib/hidden-accounts.ts` so they're filtered from every public surface (leaderboard, profile SEO, cross-viewer profile fetches) | Before running an FTUE pass, after spotting a regression, or when adding a new dogfood account. |
| [`content-experience-plan.md`](./content-experience-plan.md) | The three-workstream plan that turned LearnAI from "a hand of cards" into a stitched session experience: mem0-driven session sequencer · `PodcastNugget` Spark variant + admin feature flag · 👍/👎 feedback loop with permanent skip on 👎. Many items now subsumed into [`content-model.md`](./content-model.md) §8 — read this for the historical record | Historical reference; new work should ladder to [`content-model.md`](./content-model.md) |
| [`lenny-archive.md`](./lenny-archive.md) | The Lenny's Podcast transcripts archive · `PodcastNugget` Spark spec · curation rubric · attribution policy · topic mapping · 12 seed nuggets. **First source-anchored Spark variant** — every future `VideoNugget` / `PaperNugget` / `ReleaseNote` / `EssayNugget` / `NewsletterNugget` inherits this shape | Before authoring or reviewing any source-anchored Spark. The canonical staging area for any nugget before it lands in `content/topics/*.ts`. |
| [`content-freshness.md`](./content-freshness.md) | **Sprint #2 content engine doctrine.** Five rules — honest about age, diverse to neighbors, tonally calibrated by age band, source-anchored, self-improving via meta-implicit refinement · per-category shelf life · 7 critique chips · YouTube nugget pilot · external-source creators registry · Sprint #2 deliverables checklist | Before adding a Spark, integrating a new external source, tuning the freshness chip, or extending the critique loop. |

## Legacy / deep reference

| [`../DESIGN_DOC.md`](../DESIGN_DOC.md) | The original game-design rationale (terminology, mechanics, philosophy). |
| [`../SPRINTS.md`](../SPRINTS.md) | The first sprint plan (now superseded by [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md), kept for context). |
